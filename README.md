# Note Keywords
A system for mapping keywords from documents into a database.

Basicly hashtags. This goes along with my LaTeX class *note* which should be 
available [here](https://github.com/hugonikanor/latexclasses").

## TODO
+ Write the git hooks
+ Update the sql wrapper to select database and database user
+ Testing

---

This system currently assumes that no keyword appears multiple times in the same
text...
This might become a problem further down the line
